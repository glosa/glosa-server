## How does it work?

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/explication.png" alt="logo" width="90%"> 
</p>

On the one hand we have Glosa who would be our comment server. It **feeds in GET and POST requests**, and obediently **returns JSON**. It can only return **comments from a url** (it sorts comments by url, not ids) or **create a new comment** (**parent or child** of another comment). Nothing else. If you want to create a comment previously you will need to ask for the token to confirm that you are not a robot.

**Optionally you can receive an email** automatically when a new comment is written.

The website, CMS or mobile application, must integrate a **logic with Javascript** to make the necessary requests and render the comments properly. To make this task easier we have created an example template that you can modify to your needs. You can find the link on this page.

## Scenarios

### 1 web page, share or not a server

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/scenary-1.png" alt="logo" width="500px"> 
</p>

### 3 web pages in different domains or servers

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/scenary-2.png" alt="logo" width="500px"> 
</p>


## Origin

A Glosa is a **Spanish word**. It is defined as a **note**, usually brief, that is **written in the margin of a text** or even between its lines with the intention of clarifying some idea of it. 

The software was born with the **intention that the author's static blog would no longer depend on an external company** (Disqus), and could have control of its content. To make it as easy as possible to deploy, develop and maintain; he programmed in **Clojure**. And from the beginning it was clear to him that he didn't need a conventional database, **plain text was enough**.

## Run

1) Make sure you have Java installed.

Debian/Ubuntu

``` sh
sudo apt install default-jre
```

Mac OS

``` sh
brew install java
```

2) Create a file `config.yaml` with the following content. You can also use `config.yaml.example` as a base config and change it to fit your needs.

``` yaml
##### General #####
# If it is active it will be accessible to any client
debug: false
# It can be a domain in case of using a proxy: example.com
domain: localhost
port: 4000
# Access for APP
token: mysecret
# It indicates which domain can use it. Debug true so there are no limitations.
domain-cli: "http://example-cli.com/"

##### Notify #####
# Type of notification, currently valid: email
notify: email
subject: New comment
from: server@example.com
admin: user@example.com
# SMTP, only notify: email
smtp-host: smtp.example.com
smtp-user: smtpuser
smtp-password: smtppassword
smtp-port: 25
smtp-tls: true

##### Captcha #####
# Currently valid: time
captcha: time

##### Database #####
# Currently valid: plain
database: plain
```

3) Download the latest version of Glosa (`glosa-{version}-standalone.jar`).

https://github.com/glosa/glosa-server/releases


4) Now you can execute glosa.

```sh
java -jar target/glosa-{version}-standalone.jar
```

Great ðŸŽ‰. You already have your ðŸ”¥ own comment server ðŸ”¥.

That's it, now you just have to test that it works properly.

``` sh
curl localhost:4000/api/v1/captcha/
```

It will return a random token

``` json
{"token":"OABWNONEOOKXRMMWADPF"}
```

## Notification template for email

The first time Glosa is run it will create an HTML template with the name `template-email.html`. Edit freely.

---

## Terminal cli

To **manage some minor features** you can use the `manager` script which will filter, modify or delete the database. Previously **remember to stop Glosa** to avoid problems.

You will need to have **Node installed** on your computer and give it **permission to run**.

### Last comments

``` sh
./manager last [number of elements]
```

Example

``` sh
./manager last 3
```

### Take all comments by thread

``` sh
./manager get [thread]
```

Example

``` sh
./manager get https://glosa.example/best-SO/
```

### Update the text of a comment

``` sh
./manager update [id] [new message]
```

Example

``` sh
./manager update 1234 'I love your article.'
```

### Delete a comment

``` sh
./manager delete [id]
```

Example

``` sh
./manager delete 1234
```

## Deployment

With Nginx it's pretty quick and easy. You can use it as a reverse proxy, since Glosa contains its own web server (Jetty). You can see an example of configuration that can be useful.

### Nginx

``` nginx
server {        

        server_name glosa.domain.com;

        access_log /var/log/glosa_access.log;
        error_log /var/log/glosa_error.log;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:4000/;
            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            proxy_redirect  off;
        }
}
```

### Systemctl

To create a service in Linux is done like any application in Java. Below you can see an example.

Create a file in the following path: `/etc/systemd/system/glosa.service`

Add the content.

``` Systemctl
[Unit]
Description=Glosa
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
WorkingDirectory=/folder/jar/
ExecStart=java -jar glosa.jar

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target 
```

Finally enable and start the service.

``` sh
sudo systemctl enable glosa
sudo systemctl start glosa
```

## Create your own JAR

1) Make sure you have **openjdk** or **oracle-jdk** installed, **clojure** and  **leiningen**.

### MacOS

``` sh
brew install openjdk clojure leiningen
```

### Debian/Ubuntu

``` sh
sudo apt install default-jdk clojure leiningen
```

2) Clone the repository and enter the generated folder.

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/glosa/glosa-server.git
cd glosa-server
```

3) Run the following command to build a `jar` file.

`lein uberjar`

After this two files should be created in `target/`. We will use the standalone version: `glosa-{version}-standalone.jar`.

---

## Dev tools

It needs to be executed at the root of the project and have `Leiningen` installed.

### Lint

It checks linguistically and syntaxically if the code is correct.

``` shell
make lint
```

### Build

Build a JAR ready to distribute.

``` shell
make build
```

### Deploy

Distributed in Clojars.

``` shell
make deploy
```
